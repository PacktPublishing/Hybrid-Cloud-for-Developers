## About the Book
This book introduces you to the hybrid cloud platform, and focuses on the AWS public cloud and OpenStack private cloud platforms. It provides a deep dive into the AWS and OpenStack cloud platform services that are essential for developing hybrid cloud applications. You will learn to develop applications on AWS and OpenStack platforms with ease by leveraging various cloud services and taking advantage of PaaS.

The book provides you with the ability to leverage the ﬂexibility of choosing a cloud platform for migrating your existing resources to the cloud, as well as developing hybrid cloud applications that can migrate virtual machine instances from AWS to OpenStack and vice versa. You will also be able to build and test cloud applications without worrying about the system that your development environment supports.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
 createS3Bucket(); // invoke the method to create an S3  bucket
 listS3Buckets(); // invoke the method to list all S3 buckets
 Console.ReadKey();
}
```
